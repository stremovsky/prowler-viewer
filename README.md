# prowler-viewer

This is a Prowler JSON Report Viewer inspired by the Airtable design.

[Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler) is a popular open-source cloud scanner.

However, its built-in HTML reports feel a bit outdated ;-)

The project is using the [Tabulator](https://tabulator.info/) open-soure javascript library to show dynamic data grid.

Report example:

## How to use
* Open the ```viewer.html``` file in your browser.
* Click on "Choose File" to select the Prowler report JSON file.
* As an example, open the ```example.json``` file attached to this project to view the sample report.

You will see the report within a few seconds, depending on the file size.
